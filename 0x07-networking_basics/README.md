In this project 0x07-networking_basics We will do these tasks

OSI (Open Systems Interconnection) is an abstract model to describe layered communication and computer network design. The idea is to segregate the different parts of what make communication possible.

It is organized from the lowest level to the highest level:

The lowest level: layer 1 which is for transmission on physical layers with electrical impulse, light or radio signal
The highest level: layer 7 which is for application specific communication like SNMP for emails, HTTP for your web browser, etc
1. Types of network
2. MAC and IP address
Questions:

Which statement is correct for the TCP box:
It is a protocol that is transferring data in a slow way but surely
It is a protocol that is transferring data in a fast way and might loss data along in the process
Which statement is correct for the UDP box:
It is a protocol that is transferring data in a slow way but surely
It is a protocol that is transferring data in a fast way and might loss data along in the process
Which statement is correct for the TCP worker:
Have you received boxes x, y, z?
May I increase the rate at which I am sending you boxes?
Write a Bash script that displays listening ports:

That only shows listening sockets
That shows the PID and name of the program to which each socket belongs
Write a Bash script that pings an IP address passed as an argument.

Requirements:

Accepts a string as an argument
Displays Usage: 5-is_the_host_on_the_network {IP_ADDRESS} if no argument passed
Ping the IP 5 times

The end
